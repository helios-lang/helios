# Helios

[![Linux CI](https://github.com/tahscenery/helios/workflows/Linux%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tahscenery/helios/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Linux+CI%22)

Helios is a programming language aimed to be highly performant yet easy to use.
Although it is in the early stages of development, there are some key features
we want Helios to be defined with:

- Static memory management to avoid needing a garbage collector
- Advanced static type system with inference for reliability
- Functional-style programming with ownership semantics to produce efficient
  code that is declarative in nature
- Platform-agnostic backend and compiler with near-native performance
- Safe concurrency to avoid problems such as data races
- Seamless editor integration for developer ease-of-use
