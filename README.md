Helios is a programming language aimed to be highly performant and easy to use.

Please note that Helios is in its very early stages of development. However,
there are some key features that I want to implement in Helios one day:

- An advanced static type system with type inference
- Static memory management with ownership semantics
- Ability to compile platform-agnostic executables and libraries with
  near-native performance
- Seamless editor integration with exceptional error recovery and diagnostics

# Disclaimer

First and foremost, Helios is a hobby project. This project mainly serves me a
learning opportunity in PL design and development. As such, it will only benefit
me, at least for now.

Although I have mentioned that Helios is specifically for my own educational
purposes, I am open to suggestions and feedback. Please don't hesitate to reach
out to me here on GitHub or [through my email][email]!
