# Koi

> Any of various colorful cultivated forms of the common carp,
_Cyprinus carpio_, apparently originating in Japan and other parts of eastern
temperate Asia.

Koi is a hobby programming language written in Rust. It is a project that mostly
serves for my own learning purposes, and as such only benefits me and my
understanding of how programming languages and compilers work. I am no computer
scientist or someone knowledgeable of such topics, but I hope for this project
to be an immense source of knowledge for myself in this field.
