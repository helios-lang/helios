# Helios

[![Linux CI](https://github.com/tahscenery/helios/workflows/Linux%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tahscenery/helios/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Linux+CI%22)

Helios is a programming language aimed to be highly performant yet easy to use.
Although it is in the early stages of development, there are some key features
we want Helios to be defined with:

- A static memory management akin to Rust's ownership system
- Advanced static type system like Haskell's for reliability and speed
- Seamless editor and IDE integration for developer ease-of-use
