# Helios [![CI][badge]][ci]

Helios is a programming language aimed to be highly performant and easy to use.

Please note that Helios is in its very early stages of development. However,
there are some key features that I want to implement in Helios one day:

- An advanced static type system with type inference
- Static memory management with ownership semantics
- Seamless editor integration with exceptional error recovery and diagnostics
- Ability to compile platform-agnostic executables and libraries with
  near-native performance
- Effortless interoperability with existing C libraries

## Disclaimer

First and foremost, Helios is a hobby project. It mainly serves me as a learning
opportunity in programming language design and development. As such, Helios will
only benefit me, at least for now.

Although this is the case, I am open to suggestions and feedback! Please don't
hesitate to reach out to me here on GitHub or [through my email][email]. I will
be highly grateful for your input! ðŸ˜€
